## Project Structure
The EduYatra platform is composed of several components:

- `frontend/` — The web application (this repository), providing the user interface and client-side logic.
- `backend/` — The API and server-side logic, handling authentication, data storage, and business rules. *(Private, not shared)*
- `mobile/` — The mobile application for on-the-go access. *(Private, not shared)*

## Backend & Mobile App Notice
While the frontend is available for demonstration and review, the backend and mobile app are integral to EduYatra's full functionality. As EduYatra is an active startup project, we are unable to share the backend and mobile app source code publicly at this time. This decision is made to protect our intellectual property and ensure the security of our users and partners. We appreciate your understanding and interest in our work.

If you are interested in partnerships, integrations, or have questions about the platform, please contact us through the form available on our live demo site.
